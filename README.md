What is the prime number? Any number which is greater than 1 and it should either be divided by 1 or the number itself is called a prime number. As prime numbers cannot be divided by any other number it should only be the same number or 1
METHOD #1
Finding a prime number using for loop
As you can see in the above code we have taken two for loops because we need a list of prime numbers that will be below the given number in our program. We have included for loop within another for loop to make our calculation easier. A condition is added through if statement to break the loop once we reach our given number in code.
METHOD #2
Finding a prime number using for loop with if-else
